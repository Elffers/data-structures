1. Linked List (singly-linked)
- linear
- sequential access without destruction
- insert into random position
- one-way access from top

2. Stack
- linear
- sequential access with destruction
- one way access from top
- insert only from top

3. Queue
- linear
- sequential with destruction
- one way access from bottom

4. Priority Queue
- every value comes in with a priority value
- so, every element is a tuple
